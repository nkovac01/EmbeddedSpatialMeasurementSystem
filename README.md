# COMPENG 2DX4 Final Project
## Design
The system that is created in this project is an embedded spatial measurement system that uses a time-offlight sensor to acquire information about a surrounding area. The sensor is mounted vertically and then 
using a stepper motor, spun 360 degrees for a full rotation of measurement within a single geometric 
plane (ie. y-z plane when mounted vertically). Multiple slices of the y-z plane can be taken by moving the 
entire system along the x axis and taking another 360 degrees of samples. Mapped spatial memory is then 
sent to a PC which uses a 3D visualization program to reconstruct the points into a graphical presentation.
